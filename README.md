## General info

I've created two projects with .NET 6 to develop the Win Systems challenge:

* The first is a library project in which I have developed all the application logic.
* The second project is a test unit project with all the tests to check the library project.

## Quick Start

To clone and run my challenge, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed on your computer. From your linux, macOS or Windows command line:

```(bash)

    # Clone this repository
    
    $ git clone git@github.com:xatienza/winsystems-challenge.git
    
    # Restore libraries
    
    dotnet restore
    
    # Build the solution
    
    dotnet build
    
    # Test my challenge
    
    dotnet test

```

## Technologies

Project is created with:

* .NET 6. .NET 6 SDK 
* [RestEase Library](https://github.com/canton7/RestEase). This library helps me to manage the HttpClient.
* [xUnit](https://xunit.net/). xUnit.net is a free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework.

## Usage

There two options to try my challenge:

* **Dotnet**. The main option to test my challenge is with a set of unit tests.

```(C#)

    # Restore libraries

    dotnet restore

    # Build the solution

    dotnet build

    # Run all the unit test linked to the solution:

    dotnet test

```

* **Docker**. You can use docker to test my challenge. First, you have to build the image and then you have to run it to see the result.


```(docker)
    # Build docker image:

    docker build -t winsystems-challenge:latest .

    # Run all the test inside the docker image:

    docker run winsystems-challenge:latest

```
